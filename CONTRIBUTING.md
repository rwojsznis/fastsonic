# Contributing to Fastpotify

Fastpotify is a native Spotify client. Changes should improve the
desktop app without adding a browser, fallback services, or another backend.

## Before opening an issue

Search open and closed issues first. For a bug, use the bug form and include
the requested log and exact steps to reproduce it. Reports without enough
information to investigate may be closed.

For a feature, explain the user problem. Discuss large changes in an issue
before writing code. Existing code does not guarantee that a feature fits the
project.

Some boundaries come from Spotify or from upstream libraries:

- Local playback requires Spotify Premium because librespot requires it.
- Spotify Lossless is not available through librespot. Fastpotify will
  reconsider it if librespot gains lawful upstream support; proposals that
  depend on bypassing Spotify's DRM are out of scope.
- Spotify tracks must come from Spotify. Substituting audio from YouTube,
  Piped, `yt-dlp`, or another catalogue is out of scope.
- Fastpotify will not embed a browser engine, add telemetry, or introduce a
  Fastpotify-operated service.

Duplicate, out-of-scope, or incomplete issues may be closed with a short
explanation.

## Design principles

1. **Native and fast.** Startup time, idle work, memory use, and binary size
   are product features. Keep the UI thread free of network and disk waits.
2. **Focused.** Prefer a complete, coherent workflow over a collection of
   settings, modes, and speculative features.
3. **Honest integrations.** Use Spotify's Web API and librespot for what they
   support. Do not scrape, impersonate capabilities, bypass technical
   protections, or silently replace one service with another.
4. **Cross-platform by default.** Linux, macOS, and Windows are supported
   products. Platform-specific code must be isolated and the other targets
   must keep compiling.
5. **Small dependency surface.** Reuse the standard library and existing
   crates where practical. A new dependency needs a concrete benefit worth
   its build time, binary size, maintenance, and security cost.
6. **Visible failure, private data.** Errors should be actionable, rate limits
   should be respected, and credentials must never appear in logs. Network
   behaviour belongs in the documentation.

## Pull requests

Keep each pull request to one change. Explain why it belongs in Fastpotify,
what changed, and how you tested it. Avoid unrelated formatting, refactors,
generated prose, and large mechanical rewrites.

The same rules apply to hand-written and AI-assisted changes. The author must
understand every line and answer review comments with specific reasoning.

Code changes should include tests for behaviour that can regress. UI changes
should include before/after screenshots or a short recording and should use
demo mode where possible. User-visible behaviour, settings, files, or network
access must be documented in the same pull request.

Run the same checks CI runs before submitting:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-targets
cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --locked --all-features --doc
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --locked --all-features --no-deps
(cd docs && bundle exec jekyll build)
```

Linux needs the development packages listed in the README; `nix develop`
provides the complete development environment. MilkDrop builds libprojectM
from source, so every platform also needs CMake, a C++ compiler, and
libclang (on Windows, vcpkg with `glew:x64-windows-static-md` installed and
`VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT` pointing at it); `--no-default-features` leaves
MilkDrop out and needs none of that. CI repeats the test suite on Linux,
macOS, and Windows. Passing CI is required, but does not replace review
for correctness, product fit, maintainability, or security.
