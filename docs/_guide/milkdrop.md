Open MilkDrop from the top-bar visualiser button, Ctrl+Shift+K, Settings, or
the mini player's **V** menu. It uses
[projectM](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) to play `.milk`
presets in its own window and process.

MilkDrop is included in the Linux, macOS, and x86_64 Windows builds. The
Windows on ARM build leaves it out.

## The window

Drag the image to move the window. Double-click or press **F** for fullscreen.
Press **Esc** to leave fullscreen or close the window. Drag the lower-right
corner to resize it.

MilkDrop uses the same post-equalizer, pre-volume audio as the other
visualisers. It keeps moving at zero volume and stays flat when another device
is playing.

## Presets

Presets change every ten seconds by default. Change the interval in Settings.
Presets live in the config directory's `milkdrop` folder. Settings can download
the 550 MilkDrop 2 presets and the 9,800-preset Cream of the Crop pack. Until a
preset is installed, projectM shows its idle preset.

## Controls

- **N** or right arrow: next preset.
- **P** or left arrow: previous preset.
- **H**: switch on the next beat.
- **L**: keep the current preset.
- **R**: switch between random and folder order.
- **T**: show or hide the preset name.
- **D**: show or hide the frame rate.
- **I**: cycle the song display between a change notification, always visible,
  and hidden.
- **?** or **F1**: show all shortcuts.

The normal playback shortcuts also work.
