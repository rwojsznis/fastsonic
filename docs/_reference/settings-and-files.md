## Where things live

Fastpotify follows each platform's conventions. On Linux:

| What | Where | Safe to delete? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | `~/.config/fastpotify/settings.json` | Yes, you lose preferences |
| Winamp skins | `~/.config/fastpotify/skins/` | Yes, you add them again |
| MilkDrop presets | `~/.config/fastpotify/milkdrop/` | Yes, you fetch them again |
| Shared Web API sign-in | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/shared_web_api_token.json` | Yes, you sign in again |
| Personal Web API sign-in | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/personal_web_api_token.json` | Yes, personal acceleration is removed |
| Playback credential | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/credentials/` | Yes, you approve playback again |
| Last session | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/session.json` | Yes |
| Audio cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/audio/` | Always |
| Artwork cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/art/` | Always |
| Lyrics cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/lyrics/` | Always |
| Account-scoped playlist cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/playlists/<account-id>/` | Always |
| Last run's log | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/fastpotify.log` | Always |
| Crash log | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/panic.log` | Always |

Clearing caches never signs you out; credentials live in *state*, not
*cache*. Web API token files are written with owner-only permissions.
Signing out from Settings deletes both Web API grants and the separate
playback credential.

On macOS, settings, state, and the logs are in
`~/Library/Application Support/me.paolino.fastpotify` and the caches in
`~/Library/Caches/me.paolino.fastpotify`. On Windows, settings are in
`%APPDATA%\paolino\fastpotify\config`, state and the logs in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\paolino\fastpotify\data`, and the caches in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\paolino\fastpotify\cache`.

## settings.json

main fields are:

## Command line

```
fastpotify [OPTIONS]

  --device-name <NAME>  Spotify Connect name for this session
  -v, --verbose         More logs from librespot and the API client
```

`fastpotify.log` in the state directory is what to attach to a bug report:
it contains the last run's output, including the additional lines printed by
`fastpotify -v`. If the app crashed, attach `panic.log` from the same directory
as well.

## Demo mode

Builds made with `cargo build --features demo` accept `--demo`, which fills
the interface with sample data, useful for screenshots, theming, and
interface work. Demo mode never writes settings.

`--demo-page` opens a page, such as `home`, `playlist:pl1`, or `artist:art0`,
and `--demo-show` adds surfaces on top of it: a comma separated list of
`queue`, `devices`, `shortcuts`, `premium`, `create`, `light`, `focus`, `winamp`,
`playlist`, `eq`, `eq-shade`, and `compact`.

`--demo-shot <PATH>` writes the window to a PNG and exits, which is how the
screenshots in these pages are made:

```
cargo run --release --features demo -- \
  --demo-shot docs/screenshot.png --demo-page playlist:pl1 --demo-show queue
```

The shot is the window's own frame buffer, so it comes out at whatever size
the window is. `--demo-shot-delay <MS>` sets how long cover art has to arrive
before the frame is taken.
