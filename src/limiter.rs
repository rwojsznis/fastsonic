//! Look-ahead soft-knee limiter for final audio output.
//!
//! Equalizer and preamp boosts can exceed full scale. Hard clipping would add
//! audible harmonics, so this limiter reduces gain before the output:
//!
//! - Both channels use the same gain to preserve the stereo image.
//! - Fast attack and slow release catch transients without pumping.
//! - A soft knee introduces gain reduction gradually.
//! - A -1 dBFS threshold leaves room for inter-sample peaks after resampling.
//! - Eight milliseconds of look-ahead lets gain settle before a peak arrives.
//!
//! Samples below the knee pass unchanged. A final clamp only guards against
//! numerical overshoot.

/// Limiting threshold, below full scale to allow for inter-sample peaks.
