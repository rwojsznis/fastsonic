//! The one thing between the music and the speaker that says "no louder".
//!
//! A player has to stop somewhere. The equalizer works in floats and keeps
//! its boosts whole, so by the time sound arrives here a +12 dB preamp
//! really is four times the signal, and something has to decide what
//! reaches an output that only goes to one.
//!
//! The crude answer is to cut every sample off at the ceiling. It is one
//! line and it sounds terrible: a hard corner in a waveform is a burst of
//! odd harmonics reaching up past half the sample rate, which then folds
//! back down as tones that were never in the music. It is the harshest
//! distortion available and it lands on the loudest, most exposed part of
//! the song.
//!
//! So this is a limiter instead, the way a mastering chain ends:
//!
//! * It watches the loudest of the two channels and turns them both by the
//!   same amount, so a peak on the left never drags the image left.
//! * It moves in and out over milliseconds rather than per sample, which
//!   is what keeps the distortion out. Coming in is quick enough to catch
//!   a drum, going out slow enough not to breathe.
//! * It has a soft knee, so gain reduction arrives gradually instead of
//!   switching on. Below the knee it is exactly unity, so ordinary music
//!   passes through untouched and this costs nothing.
//! * The threshold sits a decibel under full scale. Sound is resampled
//!   downstream when the output does not run at 44.1 kHz, and a waveform
//!   sitting exactly on the ceiling comes out of a resampler slightly
//!   over it: the peaks between the samples are not bounded by the
//!   samples. A decibel of room is the usual allowance.
//!
//! * It looks ahead. The music is held back by a few milliseconds while
//!   the gain is worked out from sound that has not been heard yet, so by
//!   the time a drum hit arrives at the output the limiter is already
//!   turned down for it. Without this a limiter is always late by its own
//!   attack time, and the front edge of every transient goes through
//!   untouched, which is the thing it was put there to stop.
//!
//! The cost is eight milliseconds of delay on the whole stream, once,
//! which no one can hear and which the output's own buffering dwarfs. A
//! clamp still sits at the very end, but as a guarantee rather than a
//! mechanism: nothing in real music reaches it, because the gain is
//! already down before the sample gets there.
