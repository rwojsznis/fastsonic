//! Guards against a known AppKit bug that turns closing the window into a
//! process-ending crash.
//!
//! Closing the window sometimes makes AppKit's automatic Touch Bar support
//! try to remove a KVO observer from the window's content view a second
//! time, after something has already invalidated it once. The second
//! removal throws an `NSRangeException` from inside a run-loop observer
//! callback, a place nothing upstream of us wraps in a `@try`/`@catch`, so
//! the exception reaches the process' top-level uncaught-exception handler
//! and aborts. `WinitView`, the class named in the crash, is winit's own
//! `NSView` subclass; other AppKit-based Rust and C++ GUIs (egui/eframe,
//! Godot) hit the identical crash. There is no public API to opt a view out
//! of the automatic Touch Bar responder chain, so, the same way
//! godotengine/godot#105804 fixed the identical crash there, this patches
//! `WinitView`'s inherited `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` to run inside a
//! `@try`/`@catch`. Only an exception matching this one documented AppKit
//! bug's signature is swallowed; anything else is re-thrown so a genuinely
//! different observer-lifecycle bug still crashes and gets reported, rather
//! than being hidden by this guard.
//!
//! Install once a window (and so the `WinitView` class) exists — the
//! `Box::new(move |cc| ...)` app creator in `entrypoint.rs` is early enough
//! and already runs other one-time macOS setup.
