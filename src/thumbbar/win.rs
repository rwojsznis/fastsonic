//! The Win32 half of the thumbnail toolbar.
//!
//! `windows-sys` carries the taskbar's class identifier, its button struct,
//! and every function used here, but no COM interface definitions at all, so
//! `ITaskbarList3` is declared below as the vtable it is. The order of those
//! entries is the interface: three from `IUnknown`, five from
//! `ITaskbarList`, one from `ITaskbarList2`, then its own. Only `HrInit`,
//! `ThumbBarAddButtons` and `ThumbBarUpdateButtons` are ever called; the
//! rest are named so the two that matter sit at the offsets Windows expects.
//!
//! A window-procedure hook reports taskbar creation and button presses to the
//! shell. COM calls run during shell frames, outside the window procedure.
//!
//! Everything here runs on the thread that owns the window: `attach` from
//! the frame that creates it, `sync` from the frame loop, and the window
//! procedure from the same message pump. That is the rule COM apartments
//! and window handles both want, and nothing in this module may be called
//! from anywhere else.
